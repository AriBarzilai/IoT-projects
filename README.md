# IoT-projects
A series of small mini projects related to Internet of Things, focusing on fun. We use an ESP32 Arduino board.

# Projects:

* **Kung Fu Drums:** A combination of several ultrasonic sensors with a buzzer, along with some clever DIY, to create two gauntlets which play musical notes when you punch or block.

* **Wizard Hat:** A hat with a temperature sensor and light sensor; turns on LEDs in the darkness and a small electric fan when it is hot

* **Game Controller** A working game controller; input is received by tilting the controller (forwards, backwards, left or right) or by the two button inputs.

* **Smart Fridge** Our fridge doesn't close properly, we fixed this by making it a smart fridge: LEDs light up when the fridge is open; and if it's open for longer than a few minutes, it beeps and sends a push notification to our phones.
