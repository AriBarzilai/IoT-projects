# IoT-projects
A series of small mini projects related to Internet of Things, focusing on fun. We use an ESP32 Arduino board.

# Projects:

* **Kung Fu Drums:** A combination of several ultrasonic sensors with a buzzer, along with some clever DIY, to create two guantlets which play musical notes when you punch or block.

* **Wizard Hat:** A hat with a temperature sensor and light sensor; turns on LEDs in the darkness and a small electric fan when it is hot
